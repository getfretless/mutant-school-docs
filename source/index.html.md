# Introduction

Welcome to the Mutant School API! You can use our API to access Mutant School API endpoints, which can get information on the students, enrollment periods, and advisors in our database.

We have language bindings in raw HTTP, Ruby, and jQuery! You can view code examples in the dark area to the right, and you can switch the programming language of the examples with the tabs in the top right.

This documentation was created with [Slate](https://github.com/tripit/slate).
